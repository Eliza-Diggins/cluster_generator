Generating Hydrostatic Equilibrium Profiles
-------------------------------------------


Under the assumption of spherical symmetry, the hydrostatic equilibrium
condition for the hot gas in clusters is:

.. math::

    \frac{dP_g}{dr} = -\rho_g\frac{GM(<r)}{r}

where :math:`r` is the radius, :math:`\rho_g` is the gas density, :math:`P_g`
is the gas pressure, :math:`G` is the Newtonian gravitational constant, and
:math:`M(<r)` is the total enclosed mass of all components (dark and baryonic
matter) within :math:`r`. 

This equation can be solved in a number of ways, depending on what the initial
assumptions are.
